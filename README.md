ðŸš€ Join me in this challenge to **create 30 projects in 30 days**. This will help you to understand the basics of JavaScript, but will also teach you some CSS and HTML along the way.

I will be updating this repo and my blog with the completed projects.

If you find any bugs, please feel free to open an issue, or if you are in the mood, open a Pull Request.

You can find more information, and the links to the completed projects here:
